## Spring AOP examples project  

Content:  
* Example of Advices Before/After method executions
* Examples of Pointcut expressions (boolean condition whether to apply the advice)

#### How to use:  
Start Spring Boot application on localhost and call the `GET /test` endpoint.  
Observe application behavior in logs or using debugger.  

NOTE: if using Intellij Idea Ultimate, you will be able to see pointcut and advice match (or not) without the need to run the app each time you make a small change.
